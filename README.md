# Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in PyTorch

This code is based out of the paper [Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection.](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BJJLHbb0-)

I used baseline code from this repo  [tnakae implementation](https://github.com/tnakae/DAGMM) which was implemented in tensorflow 1.x. Thanks.

Later I modified the code to temsorflow 2.x version.

Please Let me know if there are any bugs in my code. Thank you! =)

Myself implemented this code version in Tensorflow 2.13 version using Python 3.8
